The script provided is a simple script that will funnel the twitch chat from a specified channel into a text file for use in a streaming program like OBS.

To run the script, first you must configure it to use your information. Go to the scripts directory and open config.py in a text editor.
Edit the name to your twitch username and the channel to the twitch channel you want to use (preserving the # symbol in the name).
Also, go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ and get a oauth key to replace the one under the variable "token" in the config file.

After that, just run the script.bat file in the parent directory and you should be set. Feel free to use the scene.json file if you're using OBS.
